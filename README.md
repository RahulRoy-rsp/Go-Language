# GO Language
Concepts about the GoLang I learned so far...
---

- **package main**
  - mandatory line.
  - It is the starting point to the program.
  - Go always runs with the package.

- **import "fmt"**
  - preprocessor command, meaning it commands Go compiler to include all the files from `fmt` package.
  - To import a package we usually write: `import 'package-name'`.

- **funct main()**
  - main function, where the compiler `starts the execution`.

- **Println()**
  - it is a method available in `fmt` package to `print a line`.
