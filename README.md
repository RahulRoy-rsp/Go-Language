# GO Language
Concepts about the GoLang I learned so far...
---
#### NOTE: GO is a Case Sensitive Language.
---
- **package main**
  - mandatory line.
  - It is the starting point to the program.
  - Go always runs with the package.

- **import "fmt"**
  - preprocessor command, meaning it commands Go compiler to include all the files from `fmt` package.
  - To import a package we usually write: `import 'package-name'`.

- **funct main()**
  - main function, where the compiler `starts the execution`.

- **Println()**
  - it is a method available in `fmt` package to `print a line`.

- Data Types Available:
    1. Numeric: 
       - These are numeric data which can be any number value.
       - int contains number without decimals. (Eg: 74)
       - float contains number with decimals. (Eg: 74.7)
    
    2. String
       - A string type represents the set of string values. (Eg: 'roy')
       - It means that we use alpha-numeric characters.
       - They are immutable, which means we can't change the contents of a string once its created. 
    
    3. Boolean
        - They contain only two values.
        - Either `true` or `false`. 
    
    4. Derived
       - These are user defined data types like Array, Structure, Pointers, etc.
